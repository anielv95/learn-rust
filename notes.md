Varibles in rust are inmutable in general and
we can define it as follows:

let x = 5;

If we are interested in creating 
a mutable variable we need to
specify it:

let mut x = 5;

constants are like variables but
they cannot be mutable entities
and we always need to specify
its data type:

const MY_FIRST_CONSTANT: u32 = 45;
